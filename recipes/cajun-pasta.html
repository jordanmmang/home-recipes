<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 chicken sausage links, sliced</li>
    <li>1 carton baby bella mushrooms, sliced</li>
    <li>3 cups dry penne pasta</li>
    <li>1/2 yellow onion, diced</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>3/4 cup chicken stock</li>
    <li>1/4 cup vinegar</li>
    <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>2 tbsp. tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tbsp. Cajun seasoning <a href="cajun-seasoning.html">(see recipe)</a></li>
    <li>1/2 tsp. chicken bouillon</li>
    <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Cook the pasta according to the directions on the package. Drain, rinse and set aside to cool.</li>
    <li>In a large sauté pan, heat 1 tbsp. olive oil over medium heat. Cook the sausage and mushrooms together. If using pre-cooked sausage, make sure it’s heated through thoroughly. If using raw sausage, make sure it's cooked thoroughly. Remove from the heat and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large sauté pan or pot, heat 1 tbsp. olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and cook 4-5 minutes, or until they begin to turn translucent. Add the garlic and cook another 30 seconds, or until fragrant.⁣</li>
    <li>Add the chicken bouillon to the chicken stock and vinegar mix and stir until dissolved. Add this mixture to the pan, reducing the heat to medium-low. Allow to simmer until half of the liquid has dissolved, roughly 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the tomato sauce, Cajun seasoning, and smoked paprika. Stir until dissolved.</li>
    <li>Add the heavy cream and bring back up to a simmer. Allow to simmer until some of the liquid has evaporated and the sauce has thickened, roughly 8-10 minutes.</li>
    <li>In a large container, combine the cooked pasta, cooked chicken sausage and mushrooms, and pasta sauce. If needed, season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
</ol>
