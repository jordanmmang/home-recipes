<ul>
    <li>1 lb. baby potatoes, halved</li>
    <li>1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tsp. cajun seasoning</li>
    <li>1 tsp. garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp. Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<h4>Cherry Tomato Vinaigrette</h4>
<ol>
        <li>Cut half of cherry tomatoes in half. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add shallot and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add halved and whole tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to release juices, 4-6 minutes. Mash some of tomatoes with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon vinegar and remaining 2 tablespoons oil; season with salt and pepper. Serve warm or room temperature; add chives just before serving.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Steak</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a small mixing bowl, combine the Adobo seasonings, mix thoroughly, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Season the skirt steak and let marinate for 30-45 minutes or in the refrigerator overnight.</li>
    <li>In a cast iron (or stainless steel) pan over medium-high heat, add oil. When hot and shimmering, add flank steak with tongs and allow to sear for 2 and ½ minutes on the first side.</li>
    <li>Flip steak and sear for an additional 2 and ½ minutes. For a 1-¼" flank steak (like pictured) this will give you a medium-rare flank steak. Add additional time as needed for a thicker or more well-done steak.</li>
    <li>Once your steak is cooked to your liking, remove from the pan, tent with foil, and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Slice steak thinly and against the grain.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Potatoes</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, toss potatoes with oil, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and cajun seasoning. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Place potatoes in basket of air fryer and cook at 400° for 10 minutes. Shake basket and stir potatoes and cook until potatoes are golden and tender, 8 to 10 minutes more.</li>
